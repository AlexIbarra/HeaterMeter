Version: 3.0.1

Description:

  Kernel 2.6 port of the Broadcom SDHC 2.0.2 driver (see README.v2.0.2 for details)

Building:

  Unpack to package/broadcom-sdhc26 relative to your OpenWRT build tree root directory.

  $ make menuconfig

  You should see "kmod-broadcom-sdhc26" under Kernel modules -> Block Devices. Enable it
  and set the default options which will be used in the config file.

  Build as you would with any other OpenWRT package, e.g.

  $ make package/broadcom-sdhc26/clean
  $ make package/broadcom-sdhc26/compile

  You will have a package in your bin/brcm47xx/packages/ directory named something like:

  kmod-broadcom-sdhc26_3.0.3-2_brcm47xx.ipk

Installing:

 The package can be installed like any other OpenWRT package:

 root@OpenWrt:/# opkg install kmod-broadcom-sdhc26_3.0.3-2_brcm47xx.ipk


Configuration:

 Ensure that /etc/config/broadcom_sdhc26 is properly configured for your hardware mod.
 This works on my WRT54GL with the SD card mod with:
   data in on gpio 2
   data out on gpio 4
   clock on gpio 3
   chip select on gpio 7

 Minimally, you will need to set either 'enabled' to 1.

Setup wireless:

 If you want to use wireless (e.g. b43), make sure you mask off the GPIOs appropriately first.

 Edit: /etc/modules.d/30-b43

   b43 gpiomask=0x1

 A safe value is 0 (b43 will not touch GPIOs). If you use the same GPIOs and hardware as I do,
 0x1 is safe (this enables the wifi LED).

 This gpiomask is the GPIOs to ALLOW b43 to use. (This is opposite to the gpiomask for diag,
 which is the GPIOs it is not allowed to use.)

 
Test it:

  root@OpenWRT:/# /etc/init.d/broadcom_sdhc26 start

  If the above command didn't kill your router, and you also want it to run on boot, also do:

  root@OpenWRT:/# /etc/init.d/broadcom_sdhc26 enable


Using the SD card as an external root:

  This will also work with extroot, see the extroot howto
  You'll need to have block-mount installed and configured like the howto.

  Ensure that the 'preinit' option is enabled in /etc/config/broadcom_sdhc26

  /etc/init.d/broadcom_sdhc26 disable

  Yes, that does say "disable". The script will get run in the preinit phase so you shouldn't run it twice.
